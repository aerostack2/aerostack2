# as2_behavior_tree
This module is used to implement a ROS2 node that executes navigation Behavior Trees for navigation of drone systems. The `behavior_trees` module uses the [Behavior-Tree.CPP library](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP) for the core Behavior Tree processing.

The `behavior_trees` module provides navigation-specific behavior tree nodes and a ROS2 node implementation and launchers. It uses [nav2_behavior_tree](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/main/nav2_behavior_tree) C++ template class for easily integrating ROS2 actions and services into Behavior Trees,

## Installation
Dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-behaviortree-cpp
```

You may also want to install [Groot](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot) to build your own trees.

## Aerostack2 BT Nodes
AeroStack2 offers a pull of predefined behavior nodes to build your own Behavior Tree.

### Action

<details>
<summary>Show Actions</summary>
<br>

#### Arm
Arms the drone. Input port is not intended to use by the user, but used because `nav2_behavior_tree` service action node implementation.

Returns **SUCCESS** if service result is true. Otherwise, returns **FAILURE**.

| Port | In / Out | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| service_name | In | Service name which will be called. |

#### Disarm
Disarms the drone. Input port is not intended to use by the user, but used because `nav2_behavior_tree` service action node implementation.

Returns **SUCCESS** if service result is true. Otherwise, returns **FAILURE**.

## How to create new nodes?
Three steps:
1. Implement your BT Node. You might want to use [Action](include/behavior_trees/bt_action_node.hpp) and [Service](include/behavior_trees/bt_service_node.hpp) BT handlers.
2. Register your Node into the BT [factory](src/behavior_trees_node.cpp).
2. Create the XML definition with Groot and build your new tree.
