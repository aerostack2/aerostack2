# Aerostack2

Aerostack2 is a ROS 2 framework developed to create autonomous multi-aerial-robots systems in an easy and powerful way.

![Build for Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS humble](https://github.com/aerostack2/aerostack2/actions/workflows/build-humble.yaml/badge.svg) 

Currently is currently developed and tested over ROS 2 humble (over Ubuntu 22.04) .

Versions below 1.0.9 were also developed and tested over ROS 2 galactic (over Ubuntu 20.04), can be found in the branch `EOL/galactic`.

We also have docker images with Aerostack2 preinstalled in ROS 2 Humble, check it out at [Aerostack2 Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/aerostack2).


Most important features:
- Natively developed on ROS 2.
- Complete modularity, allowing elements to be changed or interchanged without affecting the rest of the system.
- Independence of the aerial platform. Easy Sim2Real deployment.
- Project-oriented, allowing to install and use only the necessary packages for the application to be developed. 
- Swarming orientation.

Please visit the [[Aerostack2 Documentation]](https://aerostack2.github.io) for a complete documentation.
