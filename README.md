# Aerostack2

Aerostack2 is a ROS2 framework developed to create autonomous aerial-robots systems in an easy and powerful way.

Currently is developed and tested over ROS2 humble (over Ubuntu 22.04) and galactic (over Ubuntu 20.04).

![Build for Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS humble](https://github.com/aerostack2/aerostack2/actions/workflows/build-humble.yaml/badge.svg)
![Build for Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS galactic](https://github.com/aerostack2/aerostack2/actions/workflows/build-galactic.yaml/badge.svg)

Most important features:
- Natively developed on ROS2
- Complete modularity, allowing elements to be changed or interchanged without affecting the rest of the system
- Independence of the aerial platform. Easy Sim2Real deployment.
- Project-oriented, allowing to install and use only the necessary packages for the application to be developed. 
- Swarming orientation.
