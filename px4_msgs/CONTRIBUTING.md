# Contributing

*Do not* commit changes directly to this repository that change the message definitions. All the message definitions are directly generated from the [uORB msg definitions](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/tree/master/msg) on the [PX4 Firmware repository](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware). Any fixes or improvements one finds suitable to apply to the message definitions should be directly done on the uORB message files. The deployment of these are taken care by a Jenkins CI/CD stage.

### Contributing to the PX4 Firmware repository (or to this repository, not including message definitions)
